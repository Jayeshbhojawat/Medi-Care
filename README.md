# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
# for local use only
# npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npm run start
```
